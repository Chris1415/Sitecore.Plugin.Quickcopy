## [Unreleased] — PRD-000

First version of QuickCopy. Pending the manual real-portal smoke (T037 install + T038 in-tenant verification) before promotion to a tagged release.

### Added

- **Five copy buttons** — Live URL, Preview URL, Item ID, Page Title, and a Share Link split-button (Markdown default, dropdown for plain text)
- **Dark and light themes** — dark is the first-class default; the theme toggle persists the user's choice in iframe-scoped local storage under `quickcopy.theme`
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Alt+L / Alt+P / Alt+I / Alt+T / Alt+S` with a visible legend at the bottom of the panel; iframe-scoped listeners; suppressed when an editable element is focused; `Shift+Alt+<letter>` does not fire (cross-platform safety)
- **Persistent per-button error state** — failed API calls and clipboard rejections leave the affected button in a red `❌` state with an explanatory tooltip; the state clears only when the cache key changes (page navigation or version bump). No auto-retry, no backoff, no retry button
- **Honest disabled state** — Live URL is disabled with the tooltip "Not published to Edge yet — publish the page first" when the page has no published version
- **Item ID brace-stripping and trim** — `{ABC-123-DEF}` becomes `ABC-123-DEF`; whitespace-only IDs disable the button
- **Page Title fallback** — empty `displayName` falls back to `name`; both empty disables the button
- **Status live region** for success-only screen-reader announcements (errors are visual-only per ADR-0009)
- **Accessibility smoke** — `jest-axe` zero-violations in both themes; correct ARIA on the split-button (`role="group"`, `aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, focus restoration on Escape)
- **Cloud Portal registration paste-sheet** at `site/next-app/PORTAL_REGISTRATION.md`
- **Manual real-portal smoke checklist** at `site/next-app/SMOKE_TEST.md`

### Architecture

- **Marketplace Client-Side scaffold** (Scaffold 2, mirror pageshot) at `site/next-app/`, Mode A portal-brokered auth (no Auth0, no PKCE)
- **Version-keyed in-memory cache** — `${pageInfo.id}:${pageInfo.version ?? 'noversion'}`, no TTL, no manual refresh; publish bumps version and triggers automatic re-fetch + sticky-error clear
- **Parallel pre-fetch on page change** — `xmc.agent.pagesGetPagePreviewUrl`, `xmc.pages.retrievePage`, and `xmc.sites.listHosts` fire via `Promise.allSettled` so click handlers read resolved state synchronously
- **`useSyncExternalStore` cache subscription** so cache mutations trigger React re-renders (regression-pinned)
- **Blok semantic tokens only** — no raw hex outside `globals.css`; Geist Sans + Geist Mono via `next/font/google`
- **Local clipboard module** at `lib/clipboard.ts` (copy of pageshot's pattern, no shared package, no pageshot refactor)
- **Regression audit** at `lib/regression-audit.test.ts` — guards against `setTimeout`/retry leaks, `aria-live` on errors, `as string`/`as any` casts, and raw hex outside the token block

### Notes

- v0.1 ships pending **T037** (Cloud Portal registration in dogfood tenant) and **T038** (in-portal manual smoke). Both are documented at `site/next-app/SMOKE_TEST.md`.
- Six minor findings from `/test` are deferred to v0.2 (full detail in `project-planning/plans/test-report-20260426T000000Z.md`):
  - **m-1** — Item ID and Page Title cards key sticky errors on the trimmed copy value rather than the canonical page cache key
  - **m-2** — `prefetch.ts` uses `as never` casts on SDK request payloads; the regression audit allows them but the rule is broad
  - **m-3** — `<ShortcutLegend>` declares both `<ul>` and `role="list"` (redundant but harmless)
  - **m-4** — `useCopyAction` re-issues the clipboard write on rapid re-click during the 1500ms morph window (writes the same value)
  - **m-5** — no dedicated `<QuickCopyPanel>` integration test file; cross-component flows are covered piecewise plus T038 manual smoke
  - **m-6** — bundle-size NFR (≤150KB gzipped) is verified manually, not as a programmatic gate

### Test counts at this entry

- 24 test files, 172 cases (167 baseline + 5 added by the post-QA `Shift+Alt+<letter>` fix)
- Lint, typecheck, Vitest, and Next build all pass
